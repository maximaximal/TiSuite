<h1> General Information about TiCables library </h1>
<hr>
<pre>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></pre>
The TiCables library is a part of the <a href="http://www.tilp.info">TiLP</a>
project and constitutes with the other libraries a complete framework
for developping linking and/or TI calculator files oriented applications.<br>
<br>
<h3>Overview </h3>
The ticables library is able to handle the different link cables
designed for TI's graphing calculators (also called handhelds) in a fairly
transparent fashion. With this library, the developer does not have to worry about
the different link cables' characteristics as well as the different platforms.
<br>
The library provides a complete API which is very easy to use and makes
things easier.<br>
<br>
The library is completely independent of the Operating System and can
be used on several platforms such as:<br>
- any flavour of Linux (x86, Alpha, Sparc, iPAQ, ...),<br>
- Windows 2000/XP/Vista/7,<br>
- Mac OS X.<br>
<br>
The library supports all the currently available link cables:<br>
- the home-made parallel (aka $5-cable),<br>
- the home-made serial (aka $4-cable),<br>
- TI's BlackLink,<br>
- TI's GrayLink,<br>
- TI's SilverLink,<br>
- TI's DirectLink.<br>
<br>
The library supports also some 'virtual' link cables for connection
with emulators:<br>
- Virtual TI (VTI),<br>
- TiEmu,<br>
- TilEm.<br>
<br>
This library has already been used by various projects (such as TiLP,
TiEmu, KTIGCC) and by other developers (the Ti Winamp project, for instance).
A list of developers/users can be viewed on the TiLP web site
(Developers section).<br>
<br>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Requirements </h3>
In order to work, the library may need some external drivers:
<ul>
  <li>the dhahelper [Win32] / rwports [Win64] driver: is needed for
using the home-made parallel &amp; serial cables as well as TI's
BlackLink. No driver is needed for those cables under GNU/Linux.</li>
  <li>the libusb (userspace) / libusb-win32 and its driver: is needed for using TI's
SilverLink and DirectLink cables (USB).<br>
</ul>
You also need GLib 2.x.<br>
<h3> Bug Reports </h3>
There may still be some bugs in the library, please send an email
to&nbsp; the <a href="mailto:tilp-devel@lists.sf.net">tilp-devel@lists.sf.net</a>
mailing list.<br>
<br>
<h3> History </h3>
This library is a part of the TiLP project. I have been working for 10
years on TiLP as well as on some other projects (TiEmu, TiGCC).<br>
I wroten this library for several reasons:<br>
- split code,<br>
- share code between my various project,<br>
- provide source code to others.<br>
<br>
As most of Linux programs, I maintain a file which lists modifications.
This is called a ChangeLog that you can find <a
 href="ChangeLog.html">here</a>.<br>
